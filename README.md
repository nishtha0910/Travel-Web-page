# Travel-Web-page
**Project Name:** Travel Web Pages  **Description:**   I developed two web pages, `seminars.html` and `reviews.html`, for a travel company as part of an assignment. The pages displayed travel seminars and allowed users to submit reviews. I used external CSS for styling and ensured the pages were responsive and print-friendly.
